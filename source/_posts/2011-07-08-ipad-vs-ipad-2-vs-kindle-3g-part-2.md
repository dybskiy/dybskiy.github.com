<h2>iPad Wi-Fi + 3G 64GB – $550</h2>
Right after the release of iPad 2, as expected, the used market for the original iPads got pretty crowded and the prices started to drop. Sure, there were still sellers asking $450 for the Wi-Fi only 16 Gb iPad which was selling at Apple store for $399. But there are always more adequate sellers and I got the top of the line first generation iPad 3G for just $550 including a nice red cover case and Apple warranty. Could not be more happy, right?<!--more-->
<h3>One month later...</h3>
After using iPad extensively for one month I came to a sad realisation that it is not a substitute for the three main needs I chose it for:
<ul>
	<li>Email on the go</li>
	<li>Video calls (mostly Skype)</li>
	<li>Reading</li>
</ul>
<strong>Email</strong> is nice to read, especially in lanscape orientation but a pain to write. God forbid you want to copy and paste some of the text from the other email. Good luck doing that. A lot has been said about typing on the virtual keyboard. Some users even get an external bluetooth keyboard for that matter practically ruining the whole purpose of compactness. iPhone on the other hand offers almost the same email experience but is always with you.

<strong>Video calls</strong> you are much better off with the iPhone 4.

<strong>Reading </strong>really sucks on the iPad. I'm a huge fan of antiglare screens and unfortunately iPad's screen is as glossy as it gets. Meaning that it is only readable inside with no direct light on it, otherwise you can use at as a mirror but definitely not as a reading device. Not to mention all the finger-trails you get directly on the screen from using it.
<h3>Verdict</h3>
Sold via craigslist. Don't get me wrong, it's a great device for showing photos, twitter and casual browsing. Just definitely not a reading device.
<h2>Kindle 3G – $189</h2>
Frankly speaking it's not a direct comparison of these devices. It is more a combination comparison: "Macbook Pro and iPad" vs. "Macbook Air and Kindle". There's actually a third element involved – the iPhone, which is present in both setups by default which takes most of the potential iPad responsibilities.

I needed a mobile setup for work and reading, and in the end I realized that Macbook Air is what I need for mobile office and for reading I'd just get a dedicated device. My eyes are very happy I made that choice.

Two applications I use to send content to my Kindle:
<ol>
	<li><a title="Send to Kindle" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipkfnchcgalnafehpglfbommidgmalan" target="_blank">Send to Kindle</a> Chrome extension</li>
	<li><a title="Calibre App" href="http://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank">Calibre</a> – free and open source e-book library management application</li>
</ol>
<h3>verdict</h3>
After three month of using it I realized one more thing. Having a dedicated reading device not only makes the reading experience great, it also increases the time you spend reading. You are now not distracted by emails, tweets, facebook updates – it's just you and the book.
