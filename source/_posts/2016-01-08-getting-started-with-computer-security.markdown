I had a conversation with my uncle Michael recently about getting started with Computer Security. Here are some notes from that call. Input is very much appreciated as Iâ€™d like to make it a useful guide ðŸ¤“

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear kids: If you want a job in 5 years, study computer science. If you want a job forever, study computer security.</p>&mdash; Aaron Levie (@levie) <a href="https://twitter.com/levie/status/547234465198526464">December 23, 2014</a></blockquote>

There doesnâ€™t seem to be a single place/course that is a good starting point.
Field is pretty much defined by constant education, constant new attack vectors.
Michaelâ€™s specialtyâ€Šâ€”â€Šforensics and identity management, sometimes border line legal work.
Itâ€™s a huge field:
* Cryptographyâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhy hash, why salted separately, basics (mathematical architecture)
* Compression, entropy of information
* Database security
* Identity management

### Steps to getÂ started
Identity management, Cryptography 101
