The last two weeks have been super exciting for me so I'd love to share my experience with you. But first of all if you haven't gotten yourself a <a title="GitHub" href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account yet – do yourself a favour and get it right now. You'll thank me later, or you can send me 10% of your yearly salary once you get hired by one of the best companies in the Bay area (50% off standard recruiters' fee). Got it? Good, continue to the cave of wonders...<!--more-->

Another favour you can do yourself is grab a ticket to San Francisco and just come down here for a week or two right away. Stay at your friend's place or use <a title="airbnb.com" href="http://airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>. Again, thank me later – you'll meet enormous amount of interesting and smart people and you'll learn a lot. Chances are you'll get an idea for your next startup here too, the atmosphere is just so refreshing here.
