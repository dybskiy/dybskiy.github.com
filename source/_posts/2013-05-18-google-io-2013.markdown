My first Google I/O just ended and I want to take a moment, reflect on it and write down some things I've learnt that might help you in the future I/O or other conferences.

## Take breaks

I've never attended a conference that gathered 6,000 people under one roof. It was incredibly amazing, intense and I've learnt a lot in 3 days. Such amount of smart people and information can be very overwhelming.

One thing I found that really helps is stepping outside to the park across the street and grabbing some fresh air and relaxing under the sun. Bringing a friend or two with you makes it even better.

## Technical Sessions

I find that these days tech talks get recorded very well and it's much more productive to watch them later at your own pace with the comfort of being able to pause and try some of the tools or tricks presented.

It's also very rare that so many smart people come together so I think it's much better to use that opportunity to meet some of them. At the same time having an opportunity to discuss the newly revealed features or poducts right after the session might be very valuable so I'd love your input on it in the comments.

## Whom to talk to

With so many people around you, there are too many possibilities. One of the options I found is to start with the folks at demo stands. At first it seems that there's a lot, but once you start you'll notice how little time it takes to go across all of them. After all they are here to demo their products so they are very well prepared for that.

## Google Engineers

There are a lot of them at the event, they are very open and happy to show you stuff they've been working on and share some insights. This is probably one of the biggests perks of attending I/O. Do take advantage of such an amazing opportunity.

## Plan, Prepare, Execute

This one is not limited to I/O â€“ it's applicable to all aspects of life. As much as I love improvising, you can get much better results if you plan ahead, prepare and execute flawlessly. Or not so flawlessly and then improvisation comes very handy.

I'm curious to hear about your experience at I/O or other big conferences, so if you read this far feel free to leave the comment below.
