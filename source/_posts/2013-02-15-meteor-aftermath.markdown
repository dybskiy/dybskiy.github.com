We know that it's actually late for the party that looked more like this:

## tl;dr
This Wednesday a group of 35 Vancouver developers and entrepreneurs got together at Mozilla office for the first official Meteor meetup. We had great folks from *Mozilla, Mobify, Unbounce, Hootsuite* and other awesome local companies. 15 minute introduction to Meteor followed by a Q&A session and discussion with everyone involved.
