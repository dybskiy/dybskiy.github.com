Yesterday I hosted the fisrt Meteor meetup in Portland. We had an incredibly interesting crowd already and then PhoneGap team joined us to make it even more awesome!

## tl;dr
An amazing group of 20 showed up representing all the possible age, interest and experience groups. For the first time since I started giving talks about Meteor, half a year ago, I was not the only one to present an app written using Meteor – [John Brown](http://www.thisisjohnbrown.com/) showed us his creation – [WritinGoal](http://writingoal-dev.meteor.com/).
{% blockquote John Brown, Portland Meteorite %}
I have had more fun programming with Meteor than I have in quite a while.
