Hi everyone, it is finally time to remove some dust from this domain and bring it to life.

What will I post here? First of all, everything related to Photography. I really love it and would like to share my experience as much as possible.  Photos will be posted here obviously, some technical reviews.

Mobile development is another huge topic I would cover.

You are very welcome to leave comments if you want to suggest something or just to say "hi"!

どぞよろしくおねがいたします。

P.s.: Here is how my first site looked like in 1998 – <a href="http://dybskiy.com/TokyoKaraKonnitiva/index.htm" target="_blank">turn on time machine</a>.

P.p.s.: Inception was a nice movie indeed.
