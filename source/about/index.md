<!-- ## Bio -->
### What I'm looking for

Mission driven companies excite me most.

I'm taking a course in Machine Learning now so exposure to problems using it would be great.
(If you have a business need that you want to solve with ML â€“ let me know too, I might intro you to some folks.)

Role-wise, I've been in Developer Advocacy mode for almost 3 years so leading a team like that or switching to PM or team leading would be best.

### What I worked on
I've been building webapps and advocating for strong developer communities since 2006.
In 2007 co-founded and in 2009 sold markup4u.com, the PSD to HTML service.

I grew up in Ukraine and Japan; after moving to Canada worked with Canadian and US based startups as Front-End Engineer and Developer Advocate:</br>
ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ Lyft</br>
ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ Parse (Facebook co.)</br>
ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ Meteor</br>
ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ Cloudant (Acq. by IBM)</br>
ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ PlayHaven</br>
ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ unbounce.com</br>
ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ Fabric Engine</br>
ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ kik.com</br>
ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ attachments.me (Acq. by Yesware)</br>

In 2013 I organized [Apache CouchDB Conf](http://conf.couchdb.org/), in 2014 â€“ [Worldwide Meteor Day](https://blog.meteor.com/meteor-day-recap-4-259-developers-at-134-meetups-on-one-day-a5ce4385dc00).

I like to dance Argentine Tango, take photos, travel and cats.

Thanks for reading
