    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Updated January 17, 2016 (<a href="https://github.com/html5cat/getting-started-with-machine-learning">GitHub</a> repo if you prefer)</em></p>

<p>There’s a been a lot of attention directed to AI and Machine learning lately so I’d like to collect great materials to get you up to speed.</p>

<p>Ping me if something is missing or shouldn’t be here.</p>

<h2>Courses</h2>

<p>Andrew Ng’s course — <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning</a></p>

<p>Andrew Ng’s CS229 Stanford course — <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html">http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html</a></p>

<p>Practical Machine Learning (part of PML, from John Hopkins University) is a lighter version compared to Andrew Ng’s ML class, with a little overlap — <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning">https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning</a></p>

<p>AN’s ML class is a lot more advanced regarding algorithms, so requires more rigorous background knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>PML is Practical, uses the language R, which is widely used in Predictive Analytics field in the industry.</p>

<p>ML is for more CS focused folks, uses Octave (Matlab-like language).</p>

<p>You can use WEKA library if you use Java to develop. WEKA is wrapped also in R as well as in Python. But both R and Python has tons of ML libraries already.</p>

<h3>NLP</h3>

<p>Natural Language Processing by Dan Jurafsky &amp; Christopher Manning – <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp">https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp</a></p>

<p>Two books seem to be fundamental in this field:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a conversation with my uncle Michael recently about getting started with Computer Security. Here are some notes from that call. Input is very much appreciated as I’d like to make it a useful guide 🤓</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear kids: If you want a job in 5 years, study computer science.

<p>There doesn’t seem to be a single place/course that is a good starting point.
Field is pretty much defined by constant education, constant new attack vectors.
Michael’s specialty — forensics and identity management, sometimes border line legal work.
It’s a huge field:
* Cryptography — why hash, why salted separately, basics (mathematical architecture)
* Compression, entropy of information
* Database security
* Identity management</p>

<h3>Steps to get started</h3>

<p>Identity management, Cryptography 101</p>

    <id>http://dybskiy.com/how-to-write-more</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>me:</strong> I keep running around instead of sitting down and writing code and posts. How do you get yourself to write so much?
Is it something that needs to be forced in the beginning or once the proper project comes in, it will come naturally?</p>

<p><blockquote>
<strong>Driss:</strong> Would you like a real but very metaphysical answer?</br>
It comes from realizing something, I believe.</br>
I travel through time, and through places, by writing.</br>
My body is limited in where I can go.</br>
My finances are limited in where I can go.</br>
But in the universe, you can fold every place unto itself, step from one end to the other, and then unfold it, and realize the distance you’ve traveled.</br>
Now, practically speaking, what that means is that I have built up the skill in thinking, really thinking.</br>
Stopping the world and thinking.</br>
Disengaging.</br>
And I get tremendous joy out of a well sculpted story.</br>
Some people feel the same way about painting or photography.</br>
My writing has now made me interested in seeing some places, so that I can imagine my characters there.</br>
I don’t know if that helps, but it is probably the most true answer I can give.</p>

    <link href="http://dybskiy.com/laptop-sticker-standard/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-11T17:21:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dybskiy.com/laptop-sticker-standard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>or:</strong> &ldquo;How standards are made on small scale&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://twitter.com/@maxogden">Max Ogden</a> stopped by EsriPDX offices and amongst other things showed his new laptop sticker collection. We quickly agreed that there should be a standard for them and that the most useful one seems to be 2&#8221;x1.75&#8221; hexagons. I tweeted it and the reaction was way more amazing than I expected.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Laptop Sticker Standards Group (<a href="https://twitter.com/maxogden">@maxogden</a>): here&#39;a a new standard - 2&quot;x1.75&quot; hexagons. <a href="http://t.co/psodb1iCqS">pic.twitter.com/psodb1iCqS</a></p>&mdash; Yuriy Dybskiy (@dybskiy) <a href="https://twitter.com/dybskiy/statuses/454348392856944640">April 10, 2014</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>According to Twitter Analytics this tweet had &ldquo;160x normal reach&rdquo; (<em>Update</em> 285x as of Apr. 14).</p>

<p>I think there are two forces at play here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Max is undeniably awesome.</li>
<li>Laptop sticker sizes are indeed in need of some standards.</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://twitter.com/@terinjokes">Terin Stock</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/@_jden">Jason Denizac</a> were fiddling with this idea as well and Terin created a GitHub repo with the possible spec: <a href="https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec">https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very curious to see how this experiment goes.
This could be a nice playground to see how standards are made and adopted.</p>

<h2>The Screen</h2>

<p>Finally a retina screen in a 7&#8221; tablet! <a href="http://dybskiy.com/some-thoughts-on-nexus7/">A year ago</a> I got previous generation Nexus 7 and the only concern I had was the screen. It&rsquo;s actually funny how old Nexus 7&rsquo;s screen is slightly better than iPad Mini&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m genuinely amazed at how people can use iPad Mini after having retina iPhones for a while.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s retina. It&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>

<h2>Multiple accounts</h2>

<p>Again, finally! One of the greatest features of Android 4.3 is Multiple accounts. Your phone and tablet hold a lot of personal information so giving it to a friend or acquaintance to play with can make you uncomfortable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://instagr.am/p/ZTedAXFJgh/media/?size=l"></p>

<p>I just attended my first Google I/O and I want to take a moment, reflect on it and write down some things I&rsquo;ve learned that might help you in the future at I/O or other conferences.</p>

<h3>tl;dr</h3>

<ol>
<li>Plan, Prepare, Execute</li>
<li>Skip some Sessions</li>
<li>Check out the Demo Stands</li>
<li>Meet Google Engineers</li>
<li>Take Breaks</li>
</ol>

<h2>Plan, Prepare, Execute</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a little story. The night before keynote I got an idea – create a website like Hacker News, but specifically for Google I/O. Things were about to get crazy on Twitter, and it would be great to have a way to keep track of useful links. So I stayed up all night launching <a href="http://io13.meteor.com/">io13.meteor.com</a>. I tweeted about it and within the next hour about 150 people came visiting. I was super excited! Couldn&rsquo;t sleep.</p>

<p>Google I/O started and &hellip; no-one was using my little app. Things got crazy on twitter with thousands tweets per minute. Tweeting about the app was like shouting in a busy club – no one would ever hear you or care to do anything :). <strong>Pivot!</strong> Another &ldquo;Eureka&rdquo; moment – real-time collaborative note-taking and commenting of I/O sessions. I updated the site and tweeted, facebooked and google plused the link.</p>

<p><em>Results</em>: 450 unique visitors came over two days and several dozen voted or left a comment. Tools like Meteor allow you to build some amazing stuff fast, but nothing beats planning in advance and preparing well.</p>

<h2>Skip some Sessions</h2>

<p>I find that these days tech talks get recorded very well and it&rsquo;s much more productive to watch them later at your own pace with the comfort of being able to pause and try some of the tools or tricks presented.</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s very rare that so many smart people come together, I think it&rsquo;s much better to use the opportunity to meet some of them. At the same time having an opportunity to discuss the newly revealed features or products right after the session might be very valuable so balance is key here.</p>

<h2>Check out the Demo Stands</h2>

<p>With so many people around you, it might be hard to start a conversation. One of the options I found is to start talking to the folks at demo stands. After all, they&rsquo;re here to demo their products, so they are very well prepared. At first it may seem that there are a lot of companies demoing, but once you start you&rsquo;ll notice how little time it takes to go across all of them. You&rsquo;ll learn a lot and not necessarily just about that particular company.</p>

<h2>Meet Google Engineers</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting this: there are a lot of Google engineers at the event, they are very open, happy to show you stuff they&rsquo;ve been working on, and willing to share some insights. This is probably one of the biggest perks of attending I/O. Do take advantage of such an amazing opportunity.</p>

<p>Sergey Brin – tired, yet awesome:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://instagr.am/p/ZWyCDWlJux/media/?size=l"></p>

<h2>Take Breaks</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never attended a conference that gathered 6,000 people under one roof. It was incredibly intense, amazing, and it allowed me to learn lot in 3 days. The huge volume of smart people and information can be very overwhelming.</p>

<p>One thing I found that really helps is stepping outside to the park across the street, grabbing some fresh air, and relaxing under the sun. Bringing a friend or two with you makes it even better. Playing ball with a lovely couple and homeless person is also an option:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://instagr.am/p/ZY8uyXFJoT/media/?size=l"></p>

<h2>Thanks!</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a> for covering my ticket to IO, more on this later. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleJamesKirwan">Kyle Kirwan</a> for reading this first and bug-fixing.</p>

<p>Thanks to <em>you</em> for reading this far. I&rsquo;m curious to hear about your experience at I/O or other big conferences – feel free to comment below or tweet at me.</p>

    <link href="http://dybskiy.com/js-mvc-angular-vs-ember/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-11T14:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dybskiy.com/js-mvc-angular-vs-ember</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>As of late March 2013, after spending a month with each project, digging into documentation and examples available, I can say with confidence: <strong>it&rsquo;s not fair to compare them</strong>. But if you really don&rsquo;t have time to learn both – <strong>use AngularJS</strong>. Ember is not ready for prime time, <strong>yet</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>AngularJS is a dream if you&#8217;re accustomed to HTML data- style behavior like you find as part of Twitter Bootstrap&#8217;s javascript</p><footer><strong>Trek Glowacki, Ember core team member</strong> <cite><a href='http://trek.github.com/'>trek.github.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Some context</h2>

<p>Year 2013 started with a great R&amp;D project for me.
<strong>The problem:</strong> existing webapp codebase had too much technical debt and it was incredible hard to add new features without regression. <strong>Solution:</strong> re-write the app using MVC framework.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #2:</strong> which MVC framework to use? <strong>Solution:</strong> build a prototype using two most promising ones and decide. The app is purely client-side single page JavaScript app, talking to a few server APIs. Think simplified version of Double-Click or Google Analytics.</p>

<p>You might have heard or seen the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJoAnVRIVQo">talk by Double-Click team</a> about moving to AngularJS.
So have I and my gut feeling was that Angular would be a perfect fit for this project. Glancing into the future, or actually present, that assumption was spot on and it is Angular&rsquo;s sweet spot type of app.</p>

<h4>MVC framework comparison algorithm:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Check out available docs, blog posts and example apps</li>
<li>Go through Tutorial</li>
<li>Build app prototype</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ol>


<h2>How AngularJS won me over</h2>

<p>Apart from the data-bindings and MVC awesomeness that both frameworks bring to the table, here are three things that drew me to AngularJS:</p>

<h3>Focus on testing</h3>

<p>AngularJS team is using <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma</a> (formerly Testacular) to test the framework itself and go extra mile writing end-to-end and unit tests for all the steps in the <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial">Tutorial</a>. Having testable code is part of AngularJS philosophy. Making it easy to write tests is crucial. I don&rsquo;t care how good your code is – if it&rsquo;s not testable, it&rsquo;s useless in the long run.</p>

<h3>App structure</h3>

<p>It might sound like a minor thing, but if you have a team of developers working on a project, having a scalable app structure right out of the box is very helpful. Key Angular concepts translate naturally into <code>controllers</code>, <code>directives</code>, <code>filters</code> and <code>services</code> files or directories. I also like the way the app is broken into such concepts – seems very natural to me, unlike the Ember approach.</p>

<h3>Extending HTML</h3>

<p>Angular&rsquo;s main philosophy is extending HTML syntax instead of abstracting HTML away with another templating language – <em>Angular is what HTML would have been had it been designed for applications</em> (from <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/overview">Docs/Overview</a>)</p>

<p>If you are using the classical code quality measurement metric of WTFs/minute, Angular will make you happy.</p>

<h2>What about Ember?</h2>

<p>March was pretty rough for Ember team with a lot of angry posts about how confusing and hard it is getting started with it. Significant changes to the <code>router</code> didn&rsquo;t help that either and the amount of up to date examples and articles was approaching 0. That being said, best way to resolve Ember questions appeared to be just reading its source code and comments there.</p>

<p>Here is a list of interesting posts in chronological order:</p>

<ol>

</ol>


<p>Ember team is hard at work in bridging the gap of everyone&rsquo;s expectations and reality of getting up to speed with the framework.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>AngularJS is built by Google. Google has one of the strongest engineering cultures. Combine that with the resources that they have and with the power of open source and you get a really powerful mix.</p>

<p>The quality of documentation is really good and there are plenty of example code and apps out there which help tremendously in getting started.</p>

<p>During the recent Angular meetup in Mountain View I&rsquo;ve chatted quickly with the creator of AngularJS, <a href="http://twitter.com/mhevery">Miško Hevery</a>. He confirmed my assumptions that AngularJS team is in sync with Chrome Dev team and it is a very strong strategic advantage, considering interesting advances in Web Components.</p>

<p>In my excitement to show you meteor in under 5 minutes I didn&rsquo;t cover one important thing: but one thing I should have mentioned is that by default I didn&rsquo;t cover one very important topic – data security.</p>

<p>First thing people get worried about when they get introduced to the Metor is security.</p>

<p>Here is the last slide that I didn&rsquo;t get to show:</p>

    <id>http://dybskiy.com/technology/why-most-mobile-apps-suck-or-what-mobile-devs-can-learn-from-game-devs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Thanks for all the attention this post got on reddit! You guys rock! That&rsquo;s some 6,584 rocking people :) <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/x9c8m/why_most_mobile_apps_suck_or_what_mobile_web_devs/">Join the discussion</a>.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been arguing recently with a few folks that the reason Facebook mobile apps suck isn&rsquo;t because they chose HTML5 blend over pure native but rather due to poor execution on their side.</p>

<p>There were a bunch of articles written to support both sides but arguing about it isn&rsquo;t really productive, is it? Last night I read an amazing article by <a title="Patrick Wyatt" href="http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/author/patrick-wyatt">Patrick Wyatt</a> – <a title="The making of Warcraft part 1" href="http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/the-making-of-warcraft-part-1" rel="bookmark">The making of Warcraft part 1</a>. I hope you played Warcraft or at least Warcraft 2.</p>

<p>The problems outlined there make our today&rsquo;s hurtles laughable. Fitting a game into 640Kb of memory, code versioning via &ldquo;remembering which files are changed on that floppy disk&rdquo;, huge multiplayer latencies.</p>

<p>We are spoiled these days and some of us got too comfy thinking 3G and LTE can solve all those latency problems for you. The real answer to the problems with most mobile apps these days (including Facebook&rsquo;s) is Patrick&rsquo;s another great article – <a title="Reducing perceived latency" href="http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/reducing-perceived-latency" rel="bookmark">Reducing perceived latency</a> and Mike Krieger&rsquo;s (Instagram) – <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/mikeyk/p/secrets-to-lightning-fast-mobile-design?slide=1">Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design</a> slide deck.</p>

<p>Slide 25 sums it up nicely in three &lsquo;easy&rsquo; steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>perform actions optimistically</li>
<li>adaptively pre-load content</li>
<li>move bits when no-one&rsquo;s watching</li>
</ol>


<p>The later two are pretty self-explanatory, but I&rsquo;d like to elaborate a bit more on the first one. First time I saw it I assumed it ment optimizations, but what it really means is optimism.</p>

<p>Be optimistic about the and make the user feel productive. Here&rsquo;s one of the slides:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-318" title="Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design – Slide 34" src="http://dybskiy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Instagram-slide-34.png" alt="" width="789" height="760" /></p>


<p>Just like Ogre in Warcraft would say “Daboo” once you command to move, it didn&rsquo;t really mean that all the requests had finished. It was a simple acknowledgment for the user that we got your command.</p>

<p>What if the request fails? Notify user unobtrusively:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-320" title="Slide 38" src="http://dybskiy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Slide-38.png" alt="" width="272" height="381" /></p>


<p>At the end of the day, choosing tools you use is important but much more important is how you use them.</p>

<p>In light of some Vancouver game studios shutting down I don&rsquo;t think people need to be worried – it could be great for many companies if a game dev joined them.</p>

<p>So if you are a dev looking for work in Vancouver – get in touch with <a href="http://twitter.com/bmann/">Boris Mann</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/igorskee/">Igor Faletski</a>. They helped me find <a href="https://twitter.com/unbounce">Unbounce</a> team and I can&rsquo;t recommend them enough.</p>

<p>Thanks to sidcool1234 for submitting to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/x9c8m/why_most_mobile_apps_suck_or_what_mobile_web_devs/">reddit</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> reddit reader <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/barsoap">barsoap</a> pointed out the following:</p>

<blockquote>There&#8217;s one keyword here: <em>Immersion</em>.

Immersion breakers kill every game, and while break of workflow might not kill an application, it&#8217;s definitely going to make it suck.

The difference in game vs. app developers here is that game developers focus on immersion from the get-go, even design their games around it, while app developers start off with a set of functionality and, at least hopefully, consider immersion as an afterthought.

Do you remember Kai Krause&#8217;s early work, such as Kai&#8217;s Photo Soap? Those were designed around immersion, not functionality.</blockquote>
